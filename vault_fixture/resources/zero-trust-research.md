## Overview
Zero trust networking: never trust, always verify. Every request authenticated and
authorized regardless of network location.

## Key principles
- Verify explicitly — always authenticate and authorize
- Use least privilege access
- Assume breach — minimize blast radius

## Relevance
May apply to the platform migration — worth reviewing auth patterns for internal services.
