## Focus
Final dependency decisions

## Tasks
- [x] validate all deps
- [x] decide on trafilatura vs readability-lxml
- [ ] first commit

## Notes
trafilatura wins — better accuracy, actively maintained, has focused crawler built in.
pymupdf4llm over pdfplumber — clean Markdown output chunks much better for RAG.

## End of day
All decisions locked. Scaffold and first commit tomorrow.
