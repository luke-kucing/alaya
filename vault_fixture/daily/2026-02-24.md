## Focus
Finalize PRD and milestone breakdown

## Tasks
- [x] write PRD with milestones
- [x] validate dependencies
- [ ] scaffold the project

## Notes
Chose nomic-embed-text-v1.5 over all-MiniLM — the 8192 token context window matters
for long notes. ONNX backend avoids needing the full PyTorch runtime.

Synced with [[jordan]] on the [[platform-migration]] timeline. Wants to move faster.

## End of day
PRD locked. Ready to scaffold tomorrow.
