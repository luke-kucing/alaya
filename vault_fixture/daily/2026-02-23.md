## Focus
Start the second-brain project spec

## Tasks
- [x] draft initial requirements with user stories
- [x] research mcp server patterns
- [ ] set up vault structure

## Notes
Decided on LanceDB over ChromaDB for the vector store — hybrid search is the key feature.

Had a quick sync with [[alex]] about the platform migration. He seems energized.

## End of day
Good progress on the spec. Vault structure is in place.
