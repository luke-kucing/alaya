## Role
Product Manager, Developer Productivity.

## 1:1 Notes

### 2026-01-30
Priya wants a developer portal to surface service ownership and runbooks.
Suggested integrating with our internal wiki.

### 2026-01-16
Reviewed Q1 OKRs. Agreed that DORA metrics (deploy freq, lead time, MTTR)
are the right signals for developer productivity.
