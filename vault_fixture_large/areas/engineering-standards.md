## Principles
- Simple over clever.
- Explicit over implicit.
- Boring tech over shiny tech for production.
- Test everything that could break.

## Code review guidelines
- Review the design, not the style (automate style with linters).
- One approval required; two for risky changes.
- Respond within one business day.
