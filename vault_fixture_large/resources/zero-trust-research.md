## Zero Trust principles
Never trust, always verify. Assume breach. Apply least-privilege access.

## Components
- **Identity**: strong MFA, short-lived certs, device attestation.
- **Network**: micro-segmentation, mutual TLS, service mesh (Istio/Linkerd).
- **Data**: encrypt at rest and in transit; DLP policies.
